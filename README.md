# azure-openai
Starter for interacting with Azure OpenAI via API calls

This is a demo project I created to become familiar with Azure OpenAI and some of the deployable models, specifically GPT35Turbo and Embedding.

Please note that 'config.py' and 'functions.py' need to go into a folder named 'modules', based on how the code is written.
